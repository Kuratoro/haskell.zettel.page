title: Widget taking Dynamic and returning Event

A common pattern in Reflex apps is that you write widgets which are rendered based on a `Dynamic` of some value (usually server-sent response), and then have the widget return an `Event` or some other value (eg: user button clicks).

```haskell
documentEditor :: Dynamic t Document -> Event t (Id Document, Text)
documentEditor = 
  undefined
```

It is recommended to push the `Dynamic` to as deep as level as possible, where it *actually* gets used. So, if `documentEditor` is the place where it actually gets used, over there we would unpack the dynamic using the `dyn` function:

```haskell
dyn :: (Adjustable t m, NotReady t m, PostBuild t m) => Dynamic t (m a) -> m (Event t a)
```

If we had a function `Document -> m (Event t (Id Document, Text)` that renders the document editor, along with returning the "save" event (of document ID and the user-entered text), then we can use `dyn $ ffor ...` to pass that input dynamic to it.

But in return we would get `Event t (Event t (Id Document, Text))`. How do we pull the final event out of it? This is where `switchHold` comes in handy.

```haskell
switchHold :: (Reflex t, MonadHold t m) => Event t a -> Event t (Event t a) -> m (Event t a)
```

So for this particular pattern, it is common to call the widget using:

```haskell
switchHold never <=< dyn $ ffor inputDyn $ \input -> do ...
```

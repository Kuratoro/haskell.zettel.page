title: Haskell Zettelkasten
---

Welcome to the **Haskell Zettelkasten**, which seeks to be a comprehensive community-maintained knowledge-base for Haskell.

This site is a [Zettelkasten](https://neuron.srid.ca/2011401.html) and is managed by [neuron](https://neuron.zettel.page/). Its Github project is at [github.com/Kuratoro/haskell-zettelkasten](https://github.com/Kuratoro/haskell-zettelkasten).

## Overview zettels

**NOTE**: Haskell Zettelkasten was launched in late March, 2020. It probably would **take several months** before it gains an useful proportion of content. The overview portals below do not necessarily represent all zettels; go to the [z-index](/z-index.html) to access a complete list of available zettels, including those not in the primary cluster. 

* <2012503>
* <2013602>
* <2012602>
* <2013402>
* <2012404>
* <2014102>

Non-technical:

* <2013403>

## Contribute

So far it is primarily [Srid](https://www.srid.ca/) who has been adding content. If you have [ideas](https://github.com/Kuratoro/haskell-zettelkasten/projects/1) on how to grow this Zettelkasten or if you wish to contribute in some way, we'd welcome [your thoughts here](https://github.com/srid/haskell-zettelkasten/issues/new). You can also edit any page by clicking on the edit icon in the menu.

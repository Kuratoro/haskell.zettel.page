title: Haskell Zettelkasten
---

Welcome to the **Haskell Zettelkasten**, which seeks to be a comprehensive community-maintained knowledge-base for Haskell.

This site is a [Zettelkasten](https://neuron.srid.ca/2011401.html) and is managed by [neuron](https://neuron.zettel.page/). Its Github project is [here](https://github.com/srid/haskell-zettelkasten).

## Overview zettels

**NOTE**: Haskell Zettelkasten was launched in late March, 2020. It probably would **take several months** before it gains an useful proportion of content. The overview portals below do not necessarily represent all zettels; go to the [z-index](/z-index.html) to access a complete list of available zettels, including those not in the primary cluster. 

* [2012503](z://learning)
* [2013602](z://language-features)
* [2012602](z://package-management)
* [2013402](z://libraries)
* [2012404](z://frontend)
* [2014102](z://apps)

## Contribute

So far it is primarily me, [Srid](https://www.srid.ca/), who has been adding content. If you have [ideas](https://github.com/srid/haskell-zettelkasten/projects/1) on how to grow this Zettelkasten or if you wish to contribute in some way, I'd welcome [your thoughts here](https://github.com/srid/haskell-zettelkasten/issues/new).

In order to run this Zettelkasten locally,

* [Install neuron](https://neuron.srid.ca/2011501.html)
* Run `neuron -d . rib -wS`
* Visit http://localhost:8080


All available zettels added to this Zettelkasten in their chronological order are shown below for reference.

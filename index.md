title: Haskell Zettelkasten
---

Welcome to the **Haskell Zettelkasten**, which seeks to be a comprehensive community-maintained knowledge-base for Haskell.

This site is a [Zettelkasten](https://neuron.zettel.page/2011401.html) and is managed by [neuron](https://neuron.zettel.page/). Its Github project is at [github.com/Kuratoro/haskell.zettel.page](https://github.com/Kuratoro/haskell.zettel.page).

## Overview zettels

**NOTE**: Haskell Zettelkasten was launched in late March, 2020, thus it is relatively new. The overview portals below do not necessarily represent all zettels; go to the [z-index](/z-index.html) (or peruse the list below) to access all available zettels, including those not in the primary cluster. 

* <2012503>
* <2013602>
* <2012602>
* <2013402>
* <2012404>
* <2014102>

Non-technical:

[Nix](https://nixos.org/nix/) is a purely functional package manager. Think of it like a cross-platform alternative to homebrew, apt-get, stack---one that can both install packages and manage their development and deployment environments, in a purely functional manner.

Nix has a learning curve (which discourages some users), although <2016101>.

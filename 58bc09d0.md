Per [One Haskell IDE to rule them all](http://neilmitchell.blogspot.com/2020/01/one-haskell-ide-to-rule-them-all.html), IDE efforts in haskell are being combined in [haskell-language-server](https://github.com/haskell/haskell-language-server). 

At the moment, it is recommended to use [ghcide](https://github.com/digital-asset/ghcide).

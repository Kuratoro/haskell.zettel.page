> I can relate to that. Working on my project, I nee ded to construct some tiny bash shell oneliners (think `a -foo "bar" && b || c`) and then pass them to `process`. I could've opted for simple string concatenation, but I decided to create a small DSL for "and", "or" , "command", "subshell" and so on. It worked beautifully!

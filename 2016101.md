title: Nix delights users
---

Even though the 'Nix scares newcomers off' thing comes up every once in a
while, when such users actually use an application based on Nix (i.e., not
directly intending to use Nix, but using it only out of necessity), they tend to
be delightfully surprised that things 'just work' (exceeding their
expectations), compared to other mechanisms they are used to.

[Thomas Honeyman](https://thomashoneyman.com/) corroborates it:

> I’ve had a similar experience with folks hacking on a library of mine which
  provisions tooling via Nix.

  Technically they’re using Nix, but more as consumers than actively using it


## Testimonials from users on Nix

[jaygray0919](https://github.com/srid/neuron/issues/122#issuecomment-616764831) on installing neuron via Nix:

> I have **never** seen a build of this size, with so many dependencies, work so
  smoothly - frickin' incredible.

[ceedubs](https://github.com/srid/neuron/pull/102#issuecomment-614095464) on the
Haskell development environment facilitated by Nix:

> I do think that Nix has a very high barrier and will deter many potential
  users (though homebrew might be more of a solution to that than Stack).
  However, I wanted to let you know that **as someone who does use Nix and doesn't
  use Haskell**, contributing to this project was **delightfully smooth**. I was able
  to follow the instructions in the README to drop into a nix-shell (directly or
  via one of the bin/ scripts) with the necessary environment, and compiling and
  running tests automatically watched for source changes. If I start doing more
  Haskell development I'll want to figure out how to set up a proper language
  server, but Vim on top of the great Nix setup that you have here **worked
  surprisingly well**!

[alskipp](https://github.com/srid/neuron/pull/153#issue-411891677) on the
Haskell Nix development workflow:

> it was **super easy** to build and test.

[jaygray0919](https://github.com/srid/neuron/issues/179#issuecomment-628759870) on upgrading neuron via Nix:

> another flawless install! watching a neuron install is a lesson in software distribution; i've never seen anything like it. from one perspective: 'jeez there are a lot of dependencies.' from another perspective: 'jeez, i could never build anything with so many dependencies - it would overwhelm my mental model of an application.'

title: Obelisk

Obelisk is an opinionated, batteries-included framework for building production-ready web and mobile applications in Haskell. It's goal is to represent a cohesive, highly-curated set of choices that [Obsidian Systems](https://obsidian.systems/) has made for building these types of applications in a way that is extremely fast but does not compromise on production readiness.

For complex apps involving real-time communication between backend and frontend, see [2012401](z://rhyolite).

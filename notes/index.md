title: Haskell Zettelkasten
---

Welcome to the **Haskell Zettelkasten**, which aims to be a comprehensive community-maintained knowledgebase for Haskell.

This site is a [Zettelkasten](https://neuron.srid.ca/2011401.html) and is managed by [neuron](https://neuron.srid.ca/). Its Github project is [here](https://github.com/srid/haskell-zettelkasten).

## Overview zettels

**NOTE**: Haskell Zettelkasten was launched in late March, 2020. It probably would **take several months** before it gains an useful proportion of content. The overview portals below do not necessarily represent all zettels; go to the [z-index](/z-index.html) to access a complete list of available zettels, including those not in the primary cluster.

## Contribute a zettel

Bearing in mind that zettels should be [atomic and autonomous](https://neuron.srid.ca/2012101.html), if you have [ideas](https://github.com/srid/haskell-zettelkasten/projects/1) for a new zettel you can [contribute it here](https://github.com/srid/haskell-zettelkasten/issues/new); but the goal is to eventually facilitate a [collaborative editing model](https://old.reddit.com/r/haskell/comments/fpdsit/on_haskell_and_onboarding/flms0j1/).

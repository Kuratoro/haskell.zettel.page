title: Haskell Zettelkasten
---

Welcome to the Haskell [Zettelkasten](https://neuron.srid.ca/2011401.html), which aims to be a comprehensive community-maintained knowledgebase for Haskell.

This site is a Zettelkasten and is managed by [neuron](https://neuron.srid.ca/).

## Overview zettels

* [2012404](z://frontend)

## Uncategorized zettels

See [the current list of zettels](/z-index.html) for uncategorized zettels, which are yet to be linked with an overview zettel. This Zettelkasten is still in its fancy, so we have a lot of writing and organizing to do.

## Contribute a zettel

Bearing in mind that zettels should be [atomic and autonomous](https://neuron.srid.ca/2012101.html), if you have ideas for a new zettel you can [contribute it here](https://github.com/srid/haskell-zettelkasten/issues/new).

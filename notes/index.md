title: Haskell Zettelkasten
---

Welcome to the Haskell [Zettelkasten](https://neuron.srid.ca/2011401.html), which aims to be a comprehensive community-maintained knowledgebase for Haskell.

This site is a Zettelkasten and is managed by [neuron](https://neuron.srid.ca/).

## Overview zettels

**NOTE**: Haskell Zettelkasten was launched in late March, 2020. It probably would **take several months** before it gains an useful proportion of content. The overview portals below do not necessarily represent all zettels; go to the [z-index](/z-index.html) to access a complete list of available zettels, including those not yet categorized (therefore "dangling"). 

* [2012404](z://frontend)
* [2012406](z://boring-haskell)

## Contribute a zettel

Bearing in mind that zettels should be [atomic and autonomous](https://neuron.srid.ca/2012101.html), if you have [ideas](https://github.com/srid/haskell-zettelkasten/projects/1) for a new zettel you can [contribute it here](https://github.com/srid/haskell-zettelkasten/issues/new).

Testimonials from users on Nix:

[jaygray0919](https://github.com/srid/neuron/issues/122#issuecomment-616764831) on installing neuron via Nix:

> I have **never** seen a build of this size, with so many dependencies, work so
  smoothly - frickin' incredible.

[ceedubs](https://github.com/srid/neuron/pull/102#issuecomment-614095464) on the
Haskell development environment facilitated by Nix:

> I do think that Nix has a very high barrier and will deter many potential
  users (though homebrew might be more of a solution to that than Stack).
  However, I wanted to let you know that **as someone who does use Nix and doesn't
  use Haskell**, contributing to this project was **delightfully smooth**. I was able
  to follow the instructions in the README to drop into a nix-shell (directly or
  via one of the bin/ scripts) with the necessary environment, and compiling and
  running tests automatically watched for source changes. If I start doing more
  Haskell development I'll want to figure out how to set up a proper language
  server, but Vim on top of the great Nix setup that you have here **worked
  surprisingly well**!

title: Regex Portability
---

Be careful of choosing a regex library in Haskell. It may not work across different operating systems.

From [haskellwiki](https://wiki.haskell.org/Regex_Posix#regex-posix_Bugs),

> If you want a bug-free and/or portable POSIX extended regular expression library to use from Haskell, then `regex-posix` will not help you. You should use the `regex-tdfa` package instead.

## Replacement

If you want support for replacements, use [`text-regex-replace`](https://github.com/erochest/text-regex-replace) which uses [`text-icu`](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/text-icu).

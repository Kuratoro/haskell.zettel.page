title: Difference between `mtl` and `transformers`
---

Edward Kmett explains [at reddit](https://old.reddit.com/r/haskell/comments/fnpt1r/are_monad_transformers_practical_in_haskell/):

> `transformers` provides the data types themselves and requires no real language extensions. e.g. `StateT s` lives here. `mtl` provides a set of classes for the individual effects. e.g. `MonadState` lives here. `mtl` sits atop `transformers`.

> We split `mtl` from `transformers` to allow folks to experiment with different forms of class structures without having to change the actual data types used. (e.g. `monads-tf` uses type families rather than fundeps, and some of the effect system folks borrow the underlying data types.)

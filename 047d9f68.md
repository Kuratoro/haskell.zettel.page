title: Beam custom types using Data.Tagged

Using `Text` all throughout your Beam schema is not particularly type-safe. One solution is to define `newtype` wrappers; but it is not[^1] super-clear as to how to define Beam specific instances for these wrappers. There is however an alternative using [`Data.Tagged`](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/tagged) in conjunction with [type-level string literals](https://downloads.haskell.org/~ghc/latest/docs/html/users_guide/glasgow_exts.html#type-level-literals).

## Example

Say you want to add a column for user name. In place of using `Text`, you can define a type specifically for name and use that:

```haskell
import Data.Tagged

type UserName = Tagged "userName" Text
```

As of PR #457[^pr], beam has all the instances for `Tagged (tag :: k) a`. This means you can use these types in your Beam schema without having to write any database specific instances for them.

title: Beam newtype wrapper

Using `Text` all throughout in your Beam schema is not particularly type-safe. Normally you would define `newtype` wrappers. But it is not super-clear as to how to define instances for these wrappers such that they work in Beam.

## Approach A: newtype wrapper

Need to define manually FromBackendRow, etc. but this is surprisingly not easy to do. For example,

* <https://github.com/tathougies/beam/issues/451>

## Approach B: `Data.Tagged`

Oh look, Beam has an instance for `FromBackendRow be (Tagged tag t)`[^inst]. So may be we can just switch over to using `Data.Tagged` right?

[^inst]: [`(BeamBackend be, FromBackendRow be t) => FromBackendRow be (Tagged tag t)`](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/beam-core-0.8.0.0/docs/Database-Beam-Backend-SQL-Row.html#t:FromBackendRow)

Nope; somehow it couldn't use the instance:

```
backend/src/Backend/Database.hs:(63,35)-(66,39): error:
    â€¢ Could not deduce (FromBackendRow
                          Postgres (Tagged "RepoCommitSha" Text))

```

Wait, what? This instance is defined in `beam-core/Database/Beam/Backend/SQL/Row.hs` - yet GHC doesn't know about it? 

Explicitly definining it however fixes it. 


```haskell
instance (BeamBackend be, FromBackendRow be t) => FromBackendRow be (Tagged tag t) where
  fromBackendRow = Tagged <$> fromBackendRow
```

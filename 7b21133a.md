[Concur](https://ajnsit.github.io/concur/) is an unusual Web UI framework based on an entirely new paradigm, one that does not follow FRP (<2012405?cf>) or Elm architecture, but aims to combine the best parts of the both.

## Concur compared to Reflex

The author wrote concur to overcome to the shortcomings with Reflex. He [writes](https://old.reddit.com/r/haskell/comments/gcog81/designing_a_gui_framework_design_rationale_behind/fpcs5ci/):

> I wrote Concur as a way to overcome what I saw as shortcomings with Reflex. In particular layout is inherently monoidal and Reflex uses a Monad instead, and this causes code structuring issues, causing the UI code to not scale with complexity. I wrote production Reflex code before I wrote Concur, and Concur was an experiment in finding a way to retain the power of Reflex, while making layout simpler and scalable.

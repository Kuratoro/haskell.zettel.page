title: GHC User Guide -- Language Features
---

GHC User Guide has a chapter titled [Language Features](https://downloads.haskell.org/~ghc/latest/docs/html/users_guide/lang.html) that succintly explains many intermediate to advanced features of the language. An intermediate Haskeller might [find it to be an useful resource](https://old.reddit.com/r/haskell/comments/f879th/the_ghc_user_guide_is_a_great_resource_ive_been/).

  Anything that a compiler accepts might end up in the code base. So get to know your compiler.

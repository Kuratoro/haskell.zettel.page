[Three Layer Haskell Cake](https://www.parsonsmatt.org/2018/03/22/three_layer_haskell_cake.html) is the blog post by Matthew Parsons explaining one of the widely used Haskell application architectures using monad transformers, mtl and ReaderT.

## Synopsis

We design our application in three layers. 

* **Layer 1** is low-level and uses `ReaderT` to hold our application state.
* **Layer 3** contains the actual business logic, with pure functions (no IO)
* **Layer 2** glues the two layers together using `mtl` style classes

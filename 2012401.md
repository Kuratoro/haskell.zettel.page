[Rhyolite](https://github.com/obsidiansystems/rhyolite) provides a bunch of functionality needed in complex SPAs. It is normally used with [2012403](zcf:). Use [obelisk-rhyolite-template](https://github.com/srid/obelisk-rhyolite-template) to bootstrap an Obelisk+Rhyolite project.

> after hooking up everything, i.e. handlers and models and all - for example you use queryDyn in the frontend to request an interest in a certain set of data. In the backend you then provide these data and even update this set of data automatically on change (which is done via PostgreSQL 's NOTIFY and LISTEN). So you kind of get real-time updates for your queries (similar to what [Meteor](https://www.meteor.com/) is doing). But this is only one example, I guess. Rhyolite is a kind of collection of yet-to-polish stuff for [2012403](zcf://obelisk). :) 

## Future of Rhyolite

Rhyolite is expected to be superceded by Obsidian System's "Incremental View".

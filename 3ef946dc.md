title: Move orphan instances to a separate module
date: "2020-05-19"

Often we find ourselves deriving instances for a library type, but GHC will produce this warning:

```haskell
    Orphan instance: instance Monad m => PandocRaw (RoutedT t r m)
    To avoid this
        move the instance declaration to the module of the class or of the type, or
        wrap the type with a newtype and declare the instance on the new type.
```

A solution is to move orphan instances like this to a separate module; one named `Internal.hs` or `Orphans.hs`, and then tack on this module-level flag at the top[^ghcissue]:

```haskell
{-# OPTIONS_GHC -fno-warn-orphans #-}
```

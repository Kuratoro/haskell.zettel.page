[Cabal](https://www.haskell.org/cabal/) is a system for building and packaging Haskell libraries and programs. The word "cabal" can refer to either of following[1](footnote:1):

* **CABAL (the spec):** CABAL is the Common Architecture for Building Applications & Libraries. Itâ€™s a specification for defining how Haskell applications and libraries should be built, defining dependencies, etc.

* **.cabal (the file format):** The file format used to write down the aforementioned definitions for a specific package.

* **Cabal (the library):** The library implementing the above specification and file format.

* **cabal (the executable):** The cabal executable, more accurately named cabal-install, is a commandline tool that uses Cabal (the library) to resolve dependencies from Hackage and build packages.

This is *not officially supported* by Obelisk.

Obelisk has [experimental](https://github.com/obsidiansystems/obelisk/pull/758#issuecomment-640903184) support for ghcide. 

To try out the **experimental** [`ghcide`](https://github.com/digital-asset/ghcide) support:	

  * Install a `ghcide` plugin for your editor.	
  * Add `__withGhcide = true;` to your Obelisk project's `default.nix` (inside the call to `project`). With this setting, `ob shell` will provide `ghcide` as well.	
  * Add `hie-bios.sh` to the root of your project:	
      ```bash	
      cat > hie-bios.sh <<'EOF'	
      #!/usr/bin/env bash	
      source "$HOME/.bash_profile"; # NOTE: Some editors need help finding 'ob' and this assumes that `ob` is made available on your `$PATH` in `.bash_profile`	
      ob internal export-ghci-configuration > "$HIE_BIOS_OUTPUT"	
      EOF	
      chmod +x hie-bios.sh	
      ```	
      * **Note:** In some projects you need to use `ob internal export-ghci-configuration --use-relative-paths` in this script instead. This is known to happen when your project contains symlinks to other packages.	
  * Add `hie.yaml` to the root of your project:	
      ```bash	
      echo 'cradle: { bios: { program: hie-bios.sh } }' > hie.yaml	
      ```	
  * Test the configuration with `ob shell ghcide`. Assuming your project compiles and works with `ghcide` otherwise, this should succeed.	
  * Start your editor in a way that it can access the appropriate `ghcide`:	
      * This can sometimes be achieved with `ob shell 'start my editor'`.	
      * If you can't easily start your editor in a way that it inherits your shell, you may need to customize how your `ghcide` plugin finds `ghcide` or create a custom `ghcide` replacement script that you install globally. For example, for Visual Studio Code on macOS adding a script called `ghcide` to your `PATH` like the one below will cause `ghcide` from each project's `ob shell` to be used:	
          ```bash	
          #!/usr/bin/env bash	
          source "$HOME/.bash_profile"  # NOTE: This assumes that `ob` is made available on your `$PATH` in `.bash_profile`	
          ob shell "ghcide $@"	
          ```

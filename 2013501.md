title: Command-line JSON processor in Haskell

Is there an alternative to [jq](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/) but written in Haskell?

- [jl](https://github.com/chrisdone/jl): Function sed for JSON
- [trek](https://github.com/ChrisPenner/trek): Handles a lot of what [meander](https://github.com/noprompt/meander) does. No docs yet.
